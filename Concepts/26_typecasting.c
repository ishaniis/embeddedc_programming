Concept of typecasting:

/*
int a = 3;
float(a)
*/

/*
Typecasting: Converting one variable fo a given datatype to the desired data type
int a = 3, float(a)
*/

/*
Operation Rules:
1. If operation happens between two integers -> Result: int
2. If operation happens between one float and one integer -> Result: float
3. If operation happens between two float -> Result: float
*/

/*
float b = 10/2.25 
Now in this case, though b is float, still the operation between two integers will result in integer

So to get a float value of the operation
float b = float 10/2.25 
or
float b = 10/ (float 2.25)
