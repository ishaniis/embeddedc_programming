/*
Concept of loops
*/

/*
Need of Loops:
- to be efficient
- to remove repitive work - without any further code
*/

/*
Advantages of using loops:
- Helps with code reusability
- Saves time
- Helps in traversing
- - We'll discuss the concept more in detail (in arrays section)
*/


/*
Work flow 

loop start -> check condition -> TRUE -> print & increment index -> Check condition -> FALSE -> Condition met -> Loop ends 
*/

/*
Infinite loops have a definite use-case, right now we'll keep the discussion limited to finite instance of loops.
*/

/*

Types of loop
- do while loop
- while loop
- for loop
*/

/*
Syntax of do-while loop

do {


}

while (condition);
*/

/*
Do-while loop:
- Loop will execute at least once.
*/

/*
Syntax of While Loop:

while(condition){
    
}
