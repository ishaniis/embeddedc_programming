/*
Concept of loops
*/

/*
Need of Loops:
- to be efficient
- to remove repitive work - without any further code
*/

/*
Advantages of using loops:
- Helps with code reusability
- Saves time
- Helps in traversing
- - We'll discuss the concept more in detail (in arrays section)
*/


/*
Work flow 

loop start -> check condition -> TRUE -> print & increment index -> Check condition -> FALSE -> Condition met -> Loop ends 
*/

/*
Infinite loops have a definite use-case, right now we'll keep the discussion limited to finite instance of loops.
*/

/*

Types of loop
- do while loop
- while loop
- for loop
*/

/*
Syntax of do-while loop

do {


}

while (condition);
*/

/*
Do-while loop:
- Loop will execute at least once.
*/

/*
Syntax of While Loop:

while(condition){

}

*/


/*
For loops: 
- Used to iterate the statements or a part of program multiple times
- Used to traverse the data structures (arrays, linked lists etc)
*/

/*

Syntax of for loop
for (size_t i = 0; i < count; i++)
{
   }


for(expression1 ; expression 2; incremental expression)
*/

/*
For more clarity: i++ -> i = i + 1
*/

/*
Conditions for expressions in for loops
- Expression 1: Optional, if the variable is already initialized - NO need to define the expression1 all again
- Expression 2: Decides the flow of the loop, when to terminate the loop. 
- - Expression2: i<5 , j<6 : Will execute but will follow the last condition until loop reaches that conditon
- Expression 3: Use to update the loop variable (i), we can update more than 1 variable
