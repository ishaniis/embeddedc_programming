Recursions in C:
*/

/*
1. It works on the copy of itself to work on a smaller problem.

2. Helps to divide the problem into easier problems.

3. Function -> Call it's copies of its function -> with termination conditon imposed, helps to prevent to get into infinite loop

4. Any problem that can be solved recursively, it can be solved iteratively.
