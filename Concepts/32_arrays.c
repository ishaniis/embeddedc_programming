/*
Concept of Arrays
*/

/*
1. Collection of data items of same type.
Use Case: To store 100 names in class 8th, 100 names we can store in one array student_name[100]

2. Memory:
- Contigous memory locations

3. Store collection of derived data types: pointers, structures etc. 

4.  1D array is like a List, 2D array is like a table. 

5. No restriction on array by C Language rules and regulations. 

6. In some books, 1D is referred as Vectors, 2D referred as matrices, when dimension more: Array

*/

/*
Need of an array:
1. Makes code - Organized and readability.
*/

/*
Advantages:
- Helps to store similiar multiple data items of same type with single name.
- Accessing is very swift - I can calculate the address of a specific element, by the base address of an array.
- - Each element of an array is of same size

*/

/*
Syntax of array:
marks[100]

marks[] = {90,100,95}
marks[10][20] : Rows = 10, Columns = 20 
*/

/*
Disadvantages of using array:
- Poor Time Complexity of insertion and deletion
- Wastage of memory - Fixed in size
- If memory is limited and contigous memory is not present, then we won't be able to initialize the array.
